# GestureFlow

**IN PROGRESS**



**Real-time American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Recognition App**  
Building with Swift, SwiftUI, AVFoundation, Vision, and CoreML

## Overview

GestureFlow is an iOS application that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet letters in real-time using the deviceâ€™s camera. It uses AVFoundation for live video capture, Vision for image analysis, and a pre-trained CoreML model to classify ASL hand gestures.

## Features

- Real-time ASL alphabet recognition from live camera input
- Video capture using AVFoundation
- Frame analysis and hand detection using Vision
- Image classification with a CoreML model
- SwiftUI-based responsive user interface

## Technologies

- Swift  
- SwiftUI  
- AVFoundation  
- Vision  
- CoreML  
- Git


For the CoreML model, I will use a .mlmodel file I found in another repo. Will refrence it when I use it.
